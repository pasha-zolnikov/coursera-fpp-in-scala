# coursera-fpp-in-scala
Tasks from "Functional Programming Principles in Scala" course on Coursera:
https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1

I encourage you not to look on my solutions untill you've made corresponding tasks by yourself. This will aid you in better understanding the subject. Moreover I'm still learning Scala and FP hence my solutions a priori can not be considered good from all perspecrives, from code style to efficiency.
